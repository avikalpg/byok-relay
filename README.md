# byok-relay

A minimal self-hosted relay server for **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** AI web applications.

## The problem

Browser apps can't call AI APIs directly:
- `api.anthropic.com`, `api.openai.com`, and most AI providers **block browser requests via CORS**
- Putting API keys in frontend code exposes them to every user

The common workaround — a backend proxy — means the *app developer* holds the keys. That's a trust problem. Users have to trust you not to misuse or leak their keys.

**byok-relay solves this differently:** users bring their own keys, the relay stores them encrypted on *your* server, and proxies requests without ever returning the key. The user's key travels over the wire exactly once — when they register it.

## How it works

```
Browser                  byok-relay              AI Provider
  │                           │                       │
  ├─ POST /users ────────────►│                       │
  │◄─ { token } ─────────────┤                       │
  │                           │                       │
  ├─ POST /keys/anthropic ───►│                       │
  │  { key: "sk-ant-..." }    │ (stored encrypted)    │
  │◄─ { ok: true } ──────────┤                       │
  │                           │                       │
  ├─ POST /relay/anthropic ──►│                       │
  │  x-relay-token: <token>   ├─ (real key injected) ►│
  │  { model, messages... }   │                       │
  │◄─ streamed response ──────┤◄─ streamed response ──┤
```

The `token` (not the API key) is stored in the browser. The API key stays server-side, encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM.

## Supported providers

| Provider | Name | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic | `anthropic` | Claude models, SSE streaming |
| OpenAI | `openai` | GPT models, SSE streaming |
| Google | `google` | Gemini API (key in query param) |
| Groq | `groq` | Fast inference, OpenAI-compatible |
| OpenRouter | `openrouter` | 200+ models via one API |
| Mistral | `mistral` | Mistral models |
| Any OpenAI-compatible | `openai-compatible` | Pass `x-relay-base-url` header — covers LiteLLM, Ollama, Perplexity, Together AI, and any other OpenAI-compatible endpoint |

Adding a new built-in provider is ~5 lines in `src/providers.js`.

## API

### Register a user
```http
POST /users
Content-Type: application/json

{ "app_id": "my-app" }
```
→ `{ "token": "<relay-token>" }` — store in browser localStorage

### Store an API key
```http
POST /keys/anthropic
x-relay-token: <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "key": "sk-ant-..." }
```

### List stored providers (key values never returned)
```http
GET /keys
x-relay-token: <token>
```

### Delete a key
```http
DELETE /keys/anthropic
x-relay-token: <token>
```

### Relay a request
```http
POST /relay/anthropic/v1/messages
x-relay-token: <token>
Content-Type: application/json
anthropic-version: 2023-06-01

{ "model": "claude-haiku-3-5", "max_tokens": 1024, "messages": [...], "stream": true }
```
Full streaming (SSE) is supported — the response is piped directly from the provider to the browser.

### Generic OpenAI-compatible relay
```http
POST /relay/openai-compatible/v1/chat/completions
x-relay-token: <token>
x-relay-base-url: https://openrouter.ai
Content-Type: application/json

{ "model": "...", "messages": [...] }
```

## Setup

### 1. Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/avikalpg/byok-relay.git
cd byok-relay
npm install
```

### 2. Configure
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Set ENCRYPTION_SECRET (generate: openssl rand -hex 32)
# Set ALLOWED_ORIGINS to your app's domain(s)
```

### 3. Run
```bash
npm start
```

### Production (Ubuntu + systemd)
```bash
# Copy service file
sudo cp deploy/byok-relay.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable --now byok-relay

# HTTPS with nginx + Let's Encrypt
sudo apt install nginx
sudo snap install --classic certbot
sudo certbot --nginx -d relay.yourdomain.com
```

## Security

- **AES-256-GCM encryption** — keys are encrypted at rest; the `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` lives only in your server environment
- **Keys never returned** — the API after initial POST
- **Rate limiting** — 100 req/min global, 20 AI req/min per token
- **CORS** — restrict `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to your app's domain in production
- **HTTPS required** in production (mixed-content browsers block HTTP endpoints called from HTTPS pages)

## Trade-offs

- **You hold the encrypted keys** — users trust your server. If your server is compromised and the `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` leaks, all keys could be decrypted. For higher assurance, replace SQLite with a cloud KMS-backed store.
- **No user accounts** — the relay token is the only credential. Anyone who steals a user's localStorage token can use their stored key. Mitigate by scoping tokens to IP or adding optional auth.
- **Self-hosted** — you're responsible for uptime, security updates, and backups.
